    <h2>Introducing My Topic</h2>
    <p>Planned obsolescence is a blight on society. The common use of poor manufacturing and subpar materials has created expensive, short term, replaceable, garbage. 
    </p>
    <p>Planned obsolescence is the practice of making products that are meant to be used and then replaced when the newest “better” version comes out. This plan for replacement may be due to poor manufacturing and breaking often, or to be unusably subpar when compared to the newest version. In 1924, General Motors began releasing new models of their cars every year to keep people buying. With every new edition of what is effectively the same product, it creates unfathomable amounts of waste that do nothing but create bloat and pollute. Things are made to be used and thrown away as opposed to used and repaired for years to come. When things are made to be disposed of and replaced, it creates trash that otherwise could still be used if the products had been made smarter. The thing is, the products are made smartly, just intentionally bad. Glue instead of screws, materials made for single use, disposable.</p>
    <p>Obsolescence can be unplanned as well. Most technology becomes outdated after a year, not necessarily because it is “supposed to,” but because the software becomes too much for an older machine to handle, even if it was the best for the time.
    </p>
    <p>Planned obsolescence is good for the economy, sadly. In order to keep producing products that will be obsolete in a year or so, there needs to be people making them, creating a stable source of jobs. With more people working and more products circulating, the economy benefits from it. 
    </p>
    <p>The upselling and overpricing of goods that are built specifically not to last is bad for many people. If you can’t afford to replace something that has broken, you’re out of luck because repairs generally are more expensive by design and you can’t do it yourself. Apple and their products have continuously gotten to be more and more expensive while the quality has stayed the same if not lower. Apple has even created new ways for their products to break, with glass backs that must be repaired by Apple themselves if you want to keep your warranty. 
    </p>
    <p>I have experience with planned obsolescence with the earbuds I have. I have had the last 3 sony wf earbuds, the first pair would often have issues with one of the earbuds and I would have to hit it so it would work properly. It went on like that until they actually broke for different reasons, and then I got the newer ones. The newer ones then also had issues with certain earbuds not working properly, not pairing, not charging, until eventually, one broke, not both, just one and I replaced that one and then the other one started to sound like something had gotten loose in the bud. And then the one I had replaced was the only one that worked and even then it sounded like its components were not connected properly. Now I have the newest version which I have had for about a year and a half now and they still work surprisingly well. There are some issues with the charging and magnets but it is acceptable. 
    </p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Specifically engineering goods to be of low quality, easily broken, and in need of replacement is holding us as a society back. When the smartest among us spend their time creating intentionally bad products it holds themselves back and by extension, us. If people could make good, quality products that last, there would be more time and resources to work towards things that are actually beneficial.
